# speech-to-text

The sentences said in a video or a sound, with the time each one starts and ends. A VideoCraw plugin written in **Python**, because that is where the speech recognition is: it uses [faster-whisper](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper) (the Whisper models on CTranslate2), which runs on an ordinary processor and reads the sound of most video and audio files by itself.

## `transcribe`

| Input | |
|---|---|
| `media` | the video or sound: an object with an absolute `file` (a stored file, or a video as `media.open` gives it) or a path in text |
| `model` | `tiny` (about 75 MB, the default), `base`, `small`, `medium`, `large-v3`; add `.en` for English only (faster and better for English) |
| `language` | a code such as `en` or `pt`; by default the language is found out from the first seconds |
| `skipSilence` | skip the stretches with no speech (default `false`): it stops the model from inventing words in silence, but it can drop speech that sits over loud music (on the Sintel trailer it lost 3 of 5 sentences) |
| `words` | give each sentence its `words`, each with `startMs`, `endMs`, `text` and `confidence` (default false) |
| `beamSize` | how many alternatives are weighed, 1 to 10 (default 5) |

It gives:

```json
{
  "language": "en",
  "languageProbability": 0.99,
  "durationMs": 125430,
  "model": "tiny",
  "text": "Hello and welcome. Today we look at sound.",
  "sentences": [
    { "startMs": 480, "endMs": 2150, "text": "Hello and welcome.", "confidence": 0.93 },
    { "startMs": 2600, "endMs": 5900, "text": "Today we look at sound.", "confidence": 0.88 }
  ]
}
```

A sentence ends at a full stop, a question mark or an exclamation mark (not after an abbreviation such as "Dr."), after a pause of more than two seconds, or after 60 words. Its times are those of its first and last word, from the word timestamps of the model, and `confidence` is the average sureness of its words. A recording with no speech is a success with no sentences.

## Failures

`400` a param is wrong, `404` the file is not there, `422` no speech could be read from it, `503` the model could not be loaded (usually no network the first time), `CANCELLED` the call was cancelled. [plugin.json](plugin.json) lists them with the schemas of the input and the output.

## Install

This plugin brings its own runtime, as third-party plugins do: it needs Python 3.10 or newer with the package installed.

```sh
python -m venv .venv
.venv/Scripts/activate            # Linux and macOS: source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e apps/speech-to-text
```

`plugin.json` starts `python -m videoplugins_speech_to_text`, so run VideoCraw from a shell where that `python` is the one with the package (the environment above, activated). In this repository, smith's own `.venv` at the root works the same way.

The first call downloads the model (once; it goes to the Hugging Face cache folder of the user) and loads it, which takes a while; later calls in the same run reuse it. Nothing leaves the machine except that download: the recording is never uploaded.

## Notes

- Only one call is served at a time (`concurrency` 1): a model uses all the processor cores already.
- The speech is recognised on the processor with 8-bit numbers (`int8`). A graphics card would be faster; it is not used yet.
- To try it on a real recording, set `VIDEOPLUGINS_SPEECH_SAMPLE` to a video or sound with English speech and run `smith test -p speech-to-text`: one test then runs a real model (it is skipped otherwise).
- Names, numbers and punctuation are what the model writes; check anything that matters.
