# crisis-moments

Finds moments in a video that a person should look at: shouting, an alarm, a sudden loud sound, or words of alarm. A VideoCraw plugin written in Rust. It uses fixed rules on what other steps found. It has no model, needs no network and downloads nothing.

**What it is not.** It does not decide that a crisis happened, and it does not judge anyone. It makes a short list of "moments to review" and says why. It will flag moments that are fine (films, music, sport, a loud laugh) and miss some that are not. It is not a medical device or a safety system. Do not use it to decide anything about a person.

## Action `find`

Give at least one of the three lists. A list that is given but empty is fine: it means there was nothing to see, and the result is empty. Giving none of them is a 400 failure.

| Input | Shared type | Where it comes from |
|---|---|---|
| `text` | `timedText` | the `sentences` of `speech-to-text.transcribe` |
| `labels` | `timedLabel` | the `events` of `sound-events.find`, or the `appearances` of `coco-objects.find` |
| `volume` | `series` | the `windows` of `sound-volume.map` (`value` is the level in dB) |

| Setting | |
|---|---|
| `keywords` | words or phrases that flag a sentence, as whole words, ignoring case (default: help, emergency, police, ambulance, fire, hurt, bleeding, dying, let go, stop it, gun, knife, don't hurt). A list you give replaces the default. The default is English only. |
| `soundNames` | parts of sound names that flag a found sound, ignoring case (default: scream, shout, yell, cry, sob, siren, alarm, glass, shatter, explosion, gunshot, gunfire, bang) |
| `loudnessJumpDb` | how far above the usual level a window must be, 1 to 60 (default 15). The usual level is the median of all windows. |
| `mergeGapMs` | hints at most this far apart make one moment (default 2000) |
| `minMs` | shorter moments are dropped (default 0) |
| `threshold` | moments less sure than this, 0 to 1, are dropped (default 0.5) |

## Result

```json
{
  "count": 1,
  "moments": [
    {
      "startMs": 10000, "endMs": 12000,
      "label": "shouting", "confidence": 0.9,
      "sources": ["labels", "volume"],
      "evidence": [
        { "source": "labels", "detail": "heard Screaming" },
        { "source": "volume", "detail": "30 dB louder than usual" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

`moments` is a `timedLabel` list: each item has `startMs`, `endMs`, `label` (why it was flagged) and `confidence`. It can go to any step that reads timed labels. `label` is one of: `shouting`, `crying`, `alarm`, `loud impact`, `alarming sound`, `words of alarm`, `sudden loud sound`.

## How the rules work

1. Each input gives hints. A sentence with a keyword gives a hint of strength 0.6. A found sound whose label holds one of the sound names gives a hint of its own confidence (0.5 if it has none). A window at least `loudnessJumpDb` above the usual level gives a hint that grows to 1 at twice the jump (never below 0.3).
2. Hints that overlap, or are at most `mergeGapMs` apart, make one moment.
3. The confidence of a moment adds up the strongest hint of each input as independent evidence: 1 minus the chance that all are wrong. One keyword alone gives 0.6. A keyword plus a scream gives more. Two hints from one input do not add up.
4. The label of a moment comes from words or sounds first, and from loudness only when there is nothing else.
5. Moments below `threshold`, or shorter than `minMs`, are dropped.

## What it was tested on

Unit tests with made-up lists for each rule, and one run through the VideoCraw core on a test video with a steady tone (no moments, as expected). It has not been measured on real recordings, so its error rates are not known. Measure it on your own material before you rely on it.

## Privacy

It reads the words people said and the sounds heard, but only as lists that earlier steps made. It writes nothing to disk and uses no network.

## Later (not built)

An optional emotion input, a movement input, and an optional language-model check of the middle-confidence moments only. See VideoPlugins issue 10.
