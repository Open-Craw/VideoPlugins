//! Reads a sound file into samples, for the plugins that listen: any common audio format (mp3,
//! wav, flac, ogg, aac and alac, also the sound of an mp4), mixed down to one channel as numbers
//! between -1 and 1, and resampled to another rate when one is wanted. Pure Rust, nothing to install.
//!
//! A plugin that lists `wants` in its manifest gets the sound already decoded by VideoCraw, as a
//! region of raw samples in a file that is mapped (`read_audio_region`); then it needs no decoder.
//!
//! `load_sound_input` is what an action calls: it takes the `audio` and `sampleRate` of its params
//! and gives a sound, or the status code and message to fail with.
